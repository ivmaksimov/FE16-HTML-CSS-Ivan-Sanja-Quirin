CSS3 | Basic
WarmUp Questions


Discuss with your partner how the DOM is created and displayed on your screen.
What are the best CSS creation practices?
What is specificity and how can you use it to select the elements you want?
What types of CSS selectors exist, can you name examples?
How can we apply CSS code to a HTML page?


Basic - Exercise 1 

Create an HTML document, including a link to an external CSS file in the <head> section. Within the body, recreate this DOM tree structure.






Fill the structure with content of your choosing, so that you have multiple elements in your page to work with.

Now manipulate the display of those elements with CSS (using the display attribute) to:

Give all the divs a border of your choice, as well as a margin of 5px.

Hide the p element that is the direct child of the div with the id of “third”

Hide all the h1 elements on the page.

Hide all the descendants of the div with the id “second”.

Now display again ONLY the <img> elements on the page.


Basic - Exercise 2 

Take the HTML document of your previous exercise and have all its elements displayed again. 

Add two short forms with two inputs each of the type “text” . One form should be a sibling to the <h1> element and the second form to the <img> element.

The <p> element in the #first <div> is more important, so we want its font size to be bigger than those of the other <p> elements.



Basic - Exercise 3 

Create an HTML document resembling a simple newspaper article, with a headline, a list of authors, a short topical summary on top and then some regular text. 

Now, together with your partner plan on applying CSS rules through inline-styles, the <style> tag and an external CSS document simultaneously.

Define the effects that you want to achieve and spread them out over these three sources. Now prepare some fallback styles, for example a different font-family or color, in another source or with less specificity, in a way that you think they will not be affecting your document.

Is your page behaving the way it should be? How about when you remove some of the active CSS rules? Are your fallbacks being used as expected?
  Advanced
Advanced Exercise | Multiple Stylesheets
Create an HTML document that is a rough approximation of newspaper-page. Have it contain a big header on top, a sidebar on one side of it, a Lead Article next to it plus a footer on the bottom.Separate CSS declaration in multiple stylesheets, once for every section, and one concerning the HTML file as a whole. 
  Challenge
Now we will take the Intermediate exercise for day 2 HTML5 and extend it - we will add CSS to it.

Change the list that you have and make it a navbar for the website and try to add the knowledge you have in CSS so far and improve the layout with CSS.
